## Installation

### Linux

You almost certainly have it already. If not,

Debian-based (like Ubuntu):
```sh
sudo apt-get install git
```

Red Hat-based (like Fedora):
```sh
sudo yum install git
```

Note: I haven't used Fedora in many years, so double check that.

### macOS

If you have a Mac, you must use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Then installing git is easy:

```sh
brew install git
```

It's a good idea to update `brew` and your `brew` packages first:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade
```

### Windows

Download the Git for Windows installer from https://git-scm.com/downloads and run it. Then you'll also have `git-bash`, which gives you a Bash shell on your Windows machine (a superior alternative to `cmd` or Power[sic] Shell.
