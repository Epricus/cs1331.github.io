# Resources

## Get Started

   NOTE: At many points in these instructions you are told to open the "Command Prompt"/"Command Line" (Windows) or "Terminal" Mac OS X/Linux. You will be using this program a lot throughout this course and you should get familiar with it and it is reccomended that you pin it to your taskbar/dock. On Windows to open the Command Line open the start menu and search for "cmd" then click on the Command Prompt. On Mac open the Applications folder, then open the Utilities folder, from there you can open the Terminal application. On Linux the Terminal can by opened with the keyboard shortcut "ctrl-alt-t".

Complete these steps during the first week of class!
