# Array Utilities

## Introduction

In this exercise you will practice

- writing methods,
- using classes from the Java Standard Library, and
- working with arrays.

## Problem Description

You find yourself needing to do things with arrays frequently, such as getting subarrays from them, determining equality, concatenating them, and printing them.

## Solution Description

Write a class called `ArrayUtil` with the following methods:

- `public static int[] take(int n, int[] xs)`
- `public static int[] drop(int n, int[] xs)`
- `public static boolean equals(int[] xs, int[] ys)`
- `public static int[] concat(int[] xs, int[] ys)`
- `public static String toString(int[] xs)`
- `public static String toString(int[][] as)`
- `public static int[][] identity(int n)`
